            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This one goes out to all the haters and lovers of pineapple pizza. I worked in the pizza industry for four years so I believe I have some authority when I say this: pineapple DOES go on pizza. Pizza is a blank canvas and you can put anything you want on it! It's your pizza at the end of the day. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>
            <p>Let's get cooking!</p>
